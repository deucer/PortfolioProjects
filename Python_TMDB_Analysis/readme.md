# TMDB Analysis

I have chosen to use the TMDb data set to answer a series of questions pertaining to the movie industry. This data originated from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/juzershakir/tmdb-movies-dataset">Kaggle</a> but has since been cleaned by Udacity. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb).

Questions that I will attempt to answer in this analysis:

1. Which movies had the highest and which had the lowest profits?
2. Who are the directors that are producing the most profits in the movie industry?
3. Which actors appeared in the most movies?
4. Which movies had the longest runtimes and which had the shortest runtimes?
5. Average runtimes and the impact on movie profits
